# Data of "Evaluating the Effect of Interface Types and Immersive Environments on Drawing Accuracy and User Comfort" Project

## Environment
- Python 3.9
- Basically any libs are used in this project

## Status of this repo
- The accuracy data is not fully updated, but the code is ready to use if the preprocessing step is skipped
- The code contains legacy code from other projects and may not be well-organized, but it should work
- The EMG part is the latest version, and the accuracy part will be updated in the future

## File structure
- `data` folder contains raw Accuracy data files (Waiting for update because I'm travelling and I don't have access to the data)
- `EMG_Data` folder contains raw EMG data files and some calculated result files, such as EMG_AR.csv
- `figures` folder contains figures may be used in the paper, but most of them are for the testing purpose
- `preprocess.py` is the file to preprocess raw data files and generate a JSON file for further usage
- `preprocessed_data.json` is the JSON file generated by `preprocess.py`, the value is as same as the raw data files, but the format is changed to JSON and all data are in one file
- `run.py` is the file to run the filtering algorithm and generate the `processed_data.json` file. This version is implemented a simple filtering algorithm that only consider the distance measurement.
- `processed_data.json` is the filtered JSON file generated by run.py, all outliers are removed
- `run_dynamic_noise_gate.py` similar to `run.py`, but this version is implemented a dynamic noise gate style algorithm. Used in the paper.
- `sEMG_Processing_new.ipynb` is the file to process and analyse the raw EMG data files
- `utils*.py` some useful testing scripts for previewing the data, you can ignore them

## Usage
1. Place the raw accuracy data files in the `data/` folder (to be updated)
2. Place the raw EMG data files in the `EMG_Data/` folder
3. Adjust settings in all executable files to meet your needs
4. Run `preprocess.py` to generate preprocessed_data.json
5. Run `run_dynamic_noise_gate.py` to generate processed_data.json (result) using the dynamic noise gate algorithm
6. Use `sEMG_Processing_new.ipynb` to process and analyze the EMG data

This repo is intended for peer-review and research purpose only.
